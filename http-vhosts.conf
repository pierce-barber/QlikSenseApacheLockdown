# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.
#
# Qlik Sense Reverse Proxy configuration for header authentication
#
# Qlik Sense test Header configuration:
# - Create a new Virtual Proxy with Header authentication using a Static User Directory. EX: QVUSER as the Header name
# - Add the Reverse Proxy FQDN/Server Name and IP address to whitelist of virtual proxy
#
#Put the IP Address OR FQDN/Server Name of the Qlik Sense Server as SENSE_SERVER_1 and SENSE_SERVER_2. EX: qlikserver1.domain.local
#Put the IP Address OR FQDN/Server Name of the Reverse Proxy as LOCAL_ADDR. EX: 172.16.16.102
#Put the FQDN/Server Name of the Reverse Proxy as APACHE_SERVER. EX: qlikserver3.domain.local
#Put the FQDN/Server Name/URL of the Identity Provider (IdP) as IDP_ADDR. EX: dc1.domain.local
#Put the Virtual Proxy prefix as VIRTUAL_PROXY - EX: header
#Put the desired name for the Balancer confiuration as BALANCER_NAME - EX: balancer

	#	Use of the [NC] flag causes the RewriteRule to be matched in a case-insensitive manner. That is, it doesn't care whether letters appear as upper-case or lower-case in the matched URI.
	#	'nocase|NC' (no case) This makes the test case-insensitive - differences between 'A-Z' and 'a-z' are ignored, both in the expanded TestString and the CondPattern. This flag is effective only for comparisons between TestString and CondPattern. It has no effect on filesystem and subrequest checks.
	#	'ornext|OR' (or next condition) Use this to combine rule conditions with a local OR instead of the implicit AND. Typical examp
	#	Using the [F] flag causes the server to return a 403 Forbidden status code to the client. While the same behavior can be accomplished using the Deny directive, this allows more flexibility in assigning a Forbidden status.
	#	Use of the [P] flag implies [L] - that is, the request is immediately pushed through the proxy, and any following rules will not be considered.
	#	The [L] flag causes mod_rewrite to stop processing the rule set. In most contexts, this means that if the rule matches, no further rules will be processed. This corresponds to the last command in Perl, or the break command in C. Use this flag to indicate that the current rule should be applied immediately without considering further rules.
